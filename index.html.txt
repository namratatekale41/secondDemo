    <h2>News 1 :</h2>
        <p>One of the main killers involved in daylight murder of Umesh Pal was Guddu Muslim. 
       The notorious gangster was caught on cam hurling bombs at Umesh Pal and two cops. 
       Guddu Muslim is an expert in making country-made bombs and has worked with several 
       dons in UP and Bihar. Cops say Guddu Muslim can assemble a bomb while sitting on a bike using 
       materials he carries with him. 
       <p>This makes him an asset for the several dons who are active in 
       the two states. Gudduâ€™s first involvement in a murder case was in 1997 when he killed a teacher 
       of La Martinere School in Lucknow. Guddu was first involved with Satyanedra Singh gang and then 
       with Parvez Tada in Gorakhpur. He later moved to Bihar and joined the Udaybhan gang. He then 
       returned to UP and teamed up with Atiq Ahmad to kill Raju Pal.
